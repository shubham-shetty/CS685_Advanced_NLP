Once you are finished, generate a PDF via (File -> Print -> Save as PDF) and upload it to Gradescope.\n","  \n","- **Important:** check your PDF before you submit to Gradescope to make sure it exported correctly. If Colab gets confused about your syntax, it will sometimes terminate the PDF creation routine early.\n","\n","- **Important:** on Gradescope, please make sure that you tag each page with the corresponding question(s). This makes it significantly easier for our graders to grade submissions, especially with the long outputs of many of these cells. We will take off points for submissions that are not tagged.\n","\n","- When creating your final version of the PDF to hand in, please do a fresh restart and execute every cell in order.

The actual meaning of sarcastic sentences can be derived from their context or intonation when spoken. Since BERT model cannot account for intonation, and additional context is not available, the model predicts the sentiment for this sentence wrongly.  \n","A method to improve the underlying BERT based sentiment model would be to use labelled sarcastic sentences to train the model. However this approach would not be able to utilise contextual information to generate accurate predictions. [Joshi et al (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03426) provides three specific kinds of context which is needed for automatic sarcasm detection - author based context, conversational context, and topical context.
