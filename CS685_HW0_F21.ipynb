According to the authors, pre-trained multilingual language models – models which have been trained using monolingual or bilingual resources in multiple languages – have been successful in downstream cross-lingual applications. However, it was observed that fine-tuning on the multilingual BERT (mBERT) model for a cross-lingual sentence retrieval problem (XSR) lead to a decrease in performance in the original masked language model (MLM) it had been trained on. This is the issue of catastrophic forgetting in transfer learning, where a model forgets its original tasks when learning on new data. Ideally a model should be able to perform well on both tasks (old and new) without any trade-off in performance. The authors propose to use a continual learning framework to preserve performance while learning new cross-lingual tasks using the pretrained model. \n","\n","The authors chose to use the gradient episodic memory (GEM) continual learning framework to test out their hypothesis. GEM aims to minimize the loss for the nth task while constraining the loss from previous n-1 tasks, allowing them to decrease but not to increase. Either MLM or XSR is chosen to be the first task with the other being chosen for the next task (on which fine-tuning is performed). The performance of the model is tested for 2 general NLP tasks - zero-shot cross-lingual part-of-speech tagging (POS) and named entity recognition (NER). Experimental results showed that using GEM framework led to improvement in preservation of cross-linguality during the fine-tuning phase, while also improving performance on baselines.  \n","\n","Most questions I had in regard with this paper was the usage of GEM framework – why the authors finalized on GEM, what are its alternatives, and does continual learning perform equally good for all other alternatives. I am also unsure about cross-linguality – what it means, and how its performance can be calculated.\n","\n"]}]}
